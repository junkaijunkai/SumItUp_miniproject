# Java mini-project
## Introduction
The SumItUp is a simple program that helps people practice addition calculations. 
In this program, operands and the outcome are manually typed in, and the outcome will be checked.
## Operation guide
Random numbers of 'rabbits' are generated to represent values of opreands in the GUI interface, and here's about how to play different versions of it.
### Version 1
* Type in operands and outcome in the text boxes
* Click 'Check!'
* Practice a new addition if their answers are correct or re-do the problem otherwise
### Version 2
* Select the number in given options
* Click 'Check!'
* Practice a new addition if their answers are correct or re-do the problem otherwise
